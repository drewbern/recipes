Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350 and lightly grease a 9x13 pan.
 In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter, then add the sugar and stir to combine. Heat just until the mixture is hot, but don't let it bubble. Watch for it to start looking shiny as you stir it. 
As the butter is heating, n a large bowl beat the 4 eggs with the cocoa, salt, baking powder, and vanilla till smooth.
Add the hot butter & sugar mixture to the egg & cocoa mixture, stirring until smooth.
Add the flour and chocolate chips, again stirring until smooth. 
Pour the batter into your prepared pan. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the edges of the brownies look set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean. It's ok if a few crumbs stick to the toothpick...the middle should be very moist, but not unbaked!
